## Introduction
This project is a demonstration of various software development concepts and techniques implemented using React.

## Technologies Used
- React - TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Nodejs 20.10.0
- React-Tooltip
- Normalize.css

## Features
- `createAsyncThunk`: Implements asynchronous actions using Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` function.
- Interfaces: Defines custom interfaces to ensure type safety and improve code readability.
- FC (Functional Components): Uses functional components instead of class components for better performance and code organization.
- Dynamic Components: Implements dynamic components that can be rendered based on certain conditions or user interactions.
- Accordion: Implements an accordion component that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content.
- Choose Boxes as Divs: Uses div elements as boxes for user selection.
- Navigation Bar: Implements a navigation bar that hides when the user scrolls down the page.
- NetworkError: Checks if there is an issue with the user's network and displays an error message using React Portal.
- Phone Bar: Displays the current time and automatically updates it.
- Proposition Slider: Implements a slider component for mobile devices.
- Side Menu: Implements a side menu from scratch using React Portal.
- Favicon: Adds a favicon to the project.
- Description: Adds a description of the page for better SEO.
- Title: Adds a title of the page for better SEO.
- Toggle: Implements a toggle component from scratch.
- Redux Toolkit: Uses Redux Toolkit for state management.
- React Tooltip.
- Normalize.css: This project uses Normalize.css to ensure consistent styles across different browsers. It provides a reliable cross-browser baseline for CSS defaults, helping to display the UI consistently and in line with modern standards.
- Extra Reducers: Utilizes extra reducers in Redux Toolkit for handling actions that were not created using `createSlice` or `createAsyncThunk`.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across various platforms.
- Cross-Platform Testing: The application has been thoroughly tested on both mobile and desktop platforms to ensure functionality and performance.
- Pixel Perfect: The UI has been meticulously designed and implemented to match the design mockups as closely as possible, resulting in a pixel-perfect application.
- Vite: The project is built using Vite, a next-generation frontend tooling library. It provides faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- TypeScript: The project is written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. The project uses the latest version of TypeScript to take advantage of the most recent features and improvements.
